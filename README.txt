This is an empty database, used to store the extra-curricular credits
completed by the students at Royal West Academy, in Montreal West. The
students were required to complete credits from 3 of 4 categories each
year, and could not miss the same category two years in a row.

The database colour codes the entries, taking the above conditions into
account. There are several other automated features, which are listed by
clicking a button labelled "Instructions" in the top left corner.

The Extra-Curricular Activities Coordinator required that it be an Excel file.

Activities Office, 2012.
